      <h1>About</h1>

      <p>
        In college in Japan, I majored in Linguistics, was particularly interested in Syntax.
        There, I acquired the ability of analysing things systematically as well as
        learning how to speak English language profesionally. Later, I learned
        counseling/psychotherapy because then I believed that was how I could
        contribute to the society.
        <br /><br />
        As a profession, I ended up being a sales person of industrial machinary,
        where I learned a variety of things such as some mechanical engineering,
        and customer service as well as the sales techniques.
        <br /><br />
        So how did I start coding? In 2014, I met a professional programmer at a gym.
        And he told me how coding was fun and talked me into it.
        Now I am really into it.
